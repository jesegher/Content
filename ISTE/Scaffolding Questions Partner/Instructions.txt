- Identify Big Ideas: Before the lesson, pinpoint the key concepts, skills, and knowledge students need to learn.

- Prepare Questions: Develop questions according to the Four Levels of Questions:
- Level 1: Recall - Questions that require students to remember facts or basic information.
- Level 2: Skill/Concept - Questions that ask students to apply skills or concepts.
- Level 3: Strategic Thinking - Questions that require reasoning, planning, and using evidence.
- Level 4: Extended Thinking - Questions that require complex thinking and synthesis over an extended period.

- Direct and Indirect Questions: Decide whether to ask questions directly to specific students or indirectly to the whole class.
- Direct: Target a specific student (randomly or by volunteers).
- Indirect: Pose questions to the entire class (e.g., "Does anyone know...?").
- Student Responses: Ensure all students are engaged and accountable. Use wait time and think time, and revisit students if necessary.
- High-Level Questions: Encourage detailed responses and evidence-based answers for higher-level questions.
